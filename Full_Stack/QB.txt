Metric Plan:
A metric plan is a document that outlines what data will be collected and analyzed during the project, and used to get insights.
It defines how the project's success will be measured.

Roles and Responsibilities:
Stakeholding: Provides high-level support for the metrics program and champions its use within the organization.
Project Management: Leads the development of the plan, ensures alignment with project goals, and oversees its implementation.
Developing: Gathers accurate and reliable data using designated tools and processes.
Analyzing: Analyzes collected data, identifies trends and patterns, and provides insights to decision-makers.

Analyzing Software Data in Software Metrics:
Analysing software data in metrics means studying the information collected during development. 
This process helps uncover trends and patterns, such as rising complexity or defect rates. 
This helps development teams to make data-driven decisions to improve software quality and efficiency.

Software Metrics:
Software metrics are quantifiable measures that track aspects like code quality, development progress, and team performance.
Scope:
It provides a data-driven view throughout the project lifecycle to make informed decisions about resource allocation, 
risk mitigation, and overall project success.
